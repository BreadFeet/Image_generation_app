## Project Overview
This project is part of the Encode AI Bootcamp 24Q2 cohort. The goal is to create an app generating an image based on 
a prompt generated by a chosen theme. The purpose is to deepen the knowledge in creating a NextJS app using large language
model(LLM) APIs.

## Features
- Choose a theme
- Generate a prompt based on the chosen theme
- Generate an image from the prompt

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- `npm` node package manager for dependencies installation

1. Clone this repository.
```commandline
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/BreadFeet/Image_generation_app.git
# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:BreadFeet/Image_generation_app.git
```

2. Install packages from `package.json`.
```commandline
npm install
```

3. Create an `.env` for OpenAI API key.
```commandline
OPENAI_API_KEY={your-key-here}
```
How to get the key: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup)

4. Run the app.
```commandline
npm run dev
```

5. Check the app at `https://localhost:3000` on a browser.

## Conclusion
This enabled us to connect our knowledge in using chat API and image API and to comprehend React-based app development. 
It was a good opportunity to explore image model APIs and strengthen the learning of image generation.
